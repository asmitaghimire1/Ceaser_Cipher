# CEASER CIPHER
The Caesar Cipher is named after the Roman Emperor, Julius Ceasar, who encrypted handwritten messages by shifting each of the letters so that his enemies couldn't read them if they were intercepted.
This is a simple encryption algorithm where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.
